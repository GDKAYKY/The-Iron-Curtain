## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.

To add a custom preview for your scenario, go to:
map/THE_MAP/scenarios/YOUR_SCENARIO/

Ensure that the image dimensions match those of the preview.png file generated by the game.


Your custom preview image should be named previewSpecial.png and placed in the same folder as preview.png
map/THE_MAP/scenarios/YOUR_SCENARIO/previewSpecial.png


Mods path:
