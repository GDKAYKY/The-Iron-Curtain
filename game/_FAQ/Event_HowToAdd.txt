## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

For your mod the path will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/game/events/common/
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/game/events/global/
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/game/events/siege/

#####

Events for scenario:

mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/THE_MAP/scenarios/THE_SCENARIO/events/common/
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/THE_MAP/scenarios/THE_SCENARIO/events/global/

Example event:

###############################
######## EXAMPLE EVENT ########

id=unique_id_of_my_event
title=Here is the title of my event!
desc=The description of my event. This event will give bonuses if the civilization has more than 10 regiments.

image=49.png

show_in_missions=false
mission_image=2

only_once=true

trigger_and
next_and
civ_regiments_over=10
next_and
invested_in_economy_over=1
trigger_and_end

option_btn
name=Thank you, I don't collect points.
gold=10
ai=2
option_end

option_btn
name=Second button text
ai=100
province_manpower=1.2
bonus_duration=20
bonus_max_morale=5
bonus_army_morale_recovery=15
option_end

###### EXAMPLE EVENT END ######
###############################


Let's go over the code:

id=unique_id_of_my_event

## The id must be unique
## If the event can only be triggered once, the game will verify if the civilization already has this ID in the variables database.
## It shouldn't be too long if it is available for all civilizations, as it will increase the save size when all civilizations have completed the event.
## Example IDs:

id=XeGU3aP
id=Y_C_241

title=Here is the title of my event!
desc=The description of my event. This event will give bonuses if the civilization has more than 10 regiments.

## The title and description of the event.

## You can use the translation key.
## Example of a translation key:
title=exceptional_harvest.t
desc=exceptional_harvest.d

## The desc will also be used in the Mission Tree.

mission_desc=advisors_research_breakthrough.m

## Optionally, you can add mission_desc, which will be displayed(Button hover) in the Court -> Missions

############

image=49.png

## Main image for the event that appears.
## The list of all images at: game/events/images/H/
## You can use any image file:

image=city.png

## Alternatively, you can use an image from your mod folder:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/game/events/images/H/

image=event_image_from_mod.png

## The path to your image will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/game/events/images/H/event_image_from_mod.png

############

show_in_missions=false
show_in_missions=true

## Enable or disable the display of the event in Court -> Missions.

############

mission_image=2

## The button image overlay appears when the event is displayed on the right side, below the date.
## A complete list of all images can be found at: game/events/imagesMissions/H/
## Only integer numbers are allowed.

############

popUp=false
popUp=true

## The event will pop up immediately or not

############

only_once=true
only_once=false

## For each civilization. The event can be run only once or an unlimited number of times.

############ TRIGGERS ############

List of all triggers: game/_FAQ/Events_Triggers.txt
List of all triggers 2: game/_FAQ/Events.txt

############
### CODE ###

trigger_and
next_and
civ_regiments_over=10
next_and
invested_in_economy_over=1
trigger_and_end

### CODE ###
############

So, this code is a trigger for the event.
'trigger_and' marks the beginning of the event trigger,
while 'trigger_and_end' indicates the end of the event trigger.

In between we put what needs to be true to run the event.

###
next_and
civ_regiments_over=10
###

'next_and' indicates that the next condition inside the trigger will be an "AND" statement.
'civ_regiments_over=10' means that the civilization must have more than 10 regiments.

###
next_and
invested_in_economy_over=1
###
'next_and' indicates that the next condition inside the trigger will be an "AND" statement.
'invested_in_economy_over=1' means that the civilization has invested in the economy more than once.

If you used 'next_or' the trigger would work differently.

############ MULTIPLE TRIGGERS 2 ############

############
### CODE ###

trigger_and
next_and
invested_in_economy_over=1
next_or
civ_provinces_over=10
trigger_and_end

trigger_and
next_and
civ_gold_over=75
trigger_and_end

### CODE ###
############

In this example we have two separate triggers.
The first trigger will be activated if the Civilization invests more than 1 in the economy or Civilization have more than 10 provinces. THIS TRIGGER IS AND(trigger_and)
The second trigger will be activated if the Civilization has more than 75 gold in its budget. THIS TRIGGER IS AND(trigger_and)

In this case the event will pop up if both triggers will be true.


Let's create a trigger for the event

# START OF THE TRIGGER 'AND'
trigger_and

# INSIDE TRIGGER CODE

trigger_and_end
# END OF THE TRIGGER 'AND'


# You can use multiple triggers in one event
## You can choose from:

trigger_and
trigger_and_end

trigger_and_not
trigger_and_not_end

trigger_or
trigger_or_end

trigger_or_not
trigger_or_not_end


### INSIDE TRIGGER CODE

# START OF THE INSIDE TRIGGER 'AND'

next_and
invested_in_economy_over=1

# END OF THE INSIDE TRIGGER 'AND'

next_and
# The next line inside the trigger will be "and"
invested_in_economy_over=1
# In this example, A civilization must invest more than 1 economy point in its economy.

You must always choose what type the next inside trigger will be, in this case we have used "next_and".
## You can choose from:
next_and
next_and_not
next_or
next_or_not


# You can use multiple inside triggers in one trigger

###### BUTTONS & OUTCOMES ######

List of all outcomes: game/_FAQ/Events_Outcomes.txt
List of all outcomes 2: game/_FAQ/Events.txt


############
### CODE ###

option_btn
name=Thank you, I don't collect points.
gold=10
ai=2
option_end

### CODE ###
############

The buttons are where you define the event outcomes.
'option_btn' marks the beginning of the button code.
'option_end' marks the end of the button code.
Inside the button, you specify the name and outcomes for this option.

name=Thank you, I don't collect points.
## The text "Thank you, I don't collect points." will be displayed on the button

ai=2
## The variable ai=2 represents the AI's likelihood of choosing that option.
## The game will sum up the AI values of all buttons and randomly determine which option to choose for AI based on the likelihood.

So, the event outcomes should be placed between option_btn and option_end, in the middle.

In this example, the button has one outcome:
gold=10

## This means the civilization that chooses this option will receive 10 gold.




############
### CODE ###

option_btn
name=Second button text
ai=100
province_manpower=1.2
bonus_duration=20
bonus_max_morale=5
bonus_army_morale_recovery=15
option_end

### CODE ###
############


The second button to choose from is added after the first button is closed (option_end).
It is the same as the first, starting with option_btn and ending with option_end.

This time: ai=100
## The AI will be more likely to choose that option, with a probability of 100/102.


## When the button is chosen, it will result in the following outcomes:

province_manpower=1.2
bonus_duration=20
bonus_max_morale=5
bonus_army_morale_recovery=15

## A random province from all the civilization's provinces will receive +1.2 local manpower.
## An extra bonus for the civilization will be set for 20 years.
## bonus_max_morale=5 for 20 years. (as set by bonus_duration)
## bonus_army_morale_recovery=15 for 20 years. (as set by bonus_duration)
