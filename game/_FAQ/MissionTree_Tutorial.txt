## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.

Missions for the scenario for the specified Civilization:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/THE_MAP/scenarios/THE_SCENARIO/missions/

Default Missions for all Civilizaitons:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/THE_MAP/scenarios/THE_SCENARIO/missions/

To create a mission tree, you need to know how to add an event to the game, as the mission depends on events.
game/_FAQ/Event_HowToAdd.txt

An example of a mission tree mod for scenario 1440 for Brandenburg and Hungary can be found at the following path:
modsExamples/MissionTree_ForCivsInScenario/

If you want to see how the mod works in the game:
Move the MissionTree_ForCivsInScenario folder from modsExamples/ to mods/.
Run the game in scenario 1440 and start as Brandenburg or Hungary, and you will see the mission tree for these civilizations from this mod.

#############################
######## PATH FOR YOUR MOD 

The path for all of your mod missions will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/THE_MAP/scenarios/THE_SCENARIO/missions/

mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/Earth3/scenarios/1440/missions/
## For Modern World scenario it would be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/Earth3/scenarios/ModernWorld/missions/
## For Your own map it would be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/YOUR_MAP/scenarios/THE_SCENARIO/missions/

######## PATH FOR YOUR MOD END
#############################

So, let’s begin the explanation of how all of it works.

The name of the file containing missions for the specified civilization is based on the CivilizationTag:
CivilizationTag.json

## In this example, I have created missions for Brandenburg, so I named the file:
baa.json
modsExamples/MissionTree_ForCivsInScenario/map/Earth3/scenarios/1440/missions/baa.json

## You can also specify that the civilization needs to be a monarchy by naming the file:
baa_m.json

Let’s examine the code in baa.json, which contains missions for Brandenburg:

##############################
############ CODE ############

{
	Mission:
	[
		{
			ID: 0,
			Name: "ChallengePoland.t",
			ImageName: "declare_wars_2.png",
			
			MissionEvent: "challenge_poland.txt",

			TreeRow: 2,

			RequiredMission2: 1,
			
			AI: 5,
		},
		
	],
	Age_of_History: Mission
}

########## CODE END ##########
##############################

This is the code for one mission:

############ CODE ############

		{
			ID: 0,
			Name: "ChallengePoland.t",
			ImageName: "declare_wars_2.png",
			
			MissionEvent: "challenge_poland.txt",
			
			TreeColumn: 0,
			TreeRow: 1,
			
			RequiredMission: -1,
			RequiredMission2: -1,
			
			AI: 5,
		},
		
########## CODE END ##########

## New missions must always be added at the end of the mission code!

ID: 0,
## This ID must be an integer and needs to be incremental, using the next number after the last mission ID
## The ID is used for RequiredMission and RequiredMission2.

Name: "ChallengePoland.t",

## This is the name of the mission, which will be displayed in the Mission Tree. (How to add translations for mod: game/_FAQ/Translations_For_Your_Mod.txt)
## In this example, I have used the translation key, but you can also just put the text. For example:
Name: "Challenge Poland",

#############################
####### MISSION IMAGE #######

ImageName: "declare_wars_2.png",
## This defines the mission image that will be displayed in the mission tree.

The image dimensions should be 154 pixels in width and 100 pixels in height for all UI scales. (use only the H/ folder)
The images are placed in the scenario dictionary at the following path:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/Earth3/scenarios/1440/missions/missionsImages/H/

#############################

You can also use missionImages from the main missions folder in the game:
game/missions/missionsImages/

For example:
ImageName: "expand_territory.png",

The game will load this mission image from:
game/missions/missionsImages/expand_territory.png

####### MISSION IMAGE #######

#############################
####### MISSION EVENT #######

MissionEvent: "challenge_poland.txt",
## This is the most important part of the mission; in this line, you define which event to run for this mission.
## I have specified that for this mission, the game will load the "challenge_poland.txt" mission event.
## The path where your mission's events should be placed is:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/THE_MAP/scenarios/THE_SCENARIO/missions/missionsEvents/

In the modsExamples/MissionTree_ForCivsInScenario/, you can find this event to check it out at the following path:
modsExamples/MissionTree_ForCivsInScenario/map/Earth3/scenarios/1440/missions/missionsEvents/challenge_poland.txt


Inside the challenge_poland.txt file, you will find that it contains the same event code as the normal event.

desc=ChallengePoland.d
## desc=ChallengePoland.d is the description that will be shown when the mission is hovered over.
## It should inform the player about what they need to do to run this event and possibly the expected outcome.
##
## I have used the translation key, but if you won't be making any translations, you can simply provide the description.
## For example:
desc=As Brandenburg, declare war on Poland to expand your influence and assert dominance in the region.

#! This description is in the event mission file (challenge_poland.txt).

#############################

You can also use missionEvents from the main missions folder in the game:
game/missions/missionsEvents/

For example:
MissionEvent: "expand_territory.txt"

The game will load this mission from:
game/missions/missionsEvents/expand_territory.txt

####### MISSION EVENT #######
#############################


TreeColumn: 0,
## TreeColumn represents the X position in the Mission Tree.
## In this example, the position is 0. The range starts at 0 with no upper limit.

TreeRow: 1,
## TreeRow represents the Y position in the Mission Tree, with a range of 0 to 5(or more).

RequiredMission: -1,
## The ID of the first required mission to enable this mission; use -1 if none is required.

RequiredMission2: -1,
## The ID of the second required mission to enable this mission; use -1 if none is required.

AI: 5,
## It does nothing for now, but do not remove it.

So that's all!
Study the modsExamples/MissionTree_ForCivsInScenario/ mod to master mission creation.
Once you understand it, making missions becomes very easy!

#### HOW TO FIND CIV TAG ####
## Civilization TAGs:

## Locate Civilization tags for your scenario:
To find the list of civilization tags in a specific scenario, go to:
map/THE_MAP/scenarios/THE_SCENARIO/Data.json

## Find all Civilization tags and their names:
Look in the file: game/languages/civilizations/Bundle.properties
Find the entry for Belgium. Its tag will be: bel
Find the entry for Brandenburg. Its tag will be: baa
Find the entry for Hungary. Its tag will be: hun

########## CODE END ##########

In this mission, you can see that to unlock this mission, the missions with ID: 0 and ID: 1 must be unlocked first!

##############################

The main difference between an event and a mission in the mission tree is that the mission must be clicked manually,
and all previous missions must be completed if they are required.
