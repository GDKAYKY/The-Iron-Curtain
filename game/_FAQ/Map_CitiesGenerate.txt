## This feature pre-generates data to reduce loading times
##
## After adding new cities, you need to generate to which province each city belongs to in-game.


It can now be done automatically.
However, if not, then:

To do this, go to: map/MAPNAME/cities/build_cities.txt
Open the file and write inside it only:

true

# Next, launch the game, and during the loading process, the game will automatically generate all the necessary data.

Once the data is generated, don't forget to disable the data generation by setting the file map/MAPNAME/cities/build_cities.txt to:

false
