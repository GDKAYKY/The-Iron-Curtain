## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

For your mod the path will be:
mods/YourModName/game/cities/

#####

Go to:
game/cities/

The files in this folder are named after Civilization tags.

For example: fra.txt

fra corresponds to France.

In this file, you list cities that will have their names changed when France controls provinces with those names.

Example:
Lisbon=Lisbonne
Zaragoza=Saragosse

## If France controls Lisbon, the province name will change to: Lisbonne.
