## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

For your mod the path will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/YOUR_MAP/

#####

The overlays are in the path:
map/THE_MAP/background/overlays/

There are two configuration files: one for land overlays and another for sea overlays.

Overlays.json
# This file is for land overlays.

OverlaysSea.json
# This file is for sea overlays.

If you want to disable overlays, don't know how to create them, or need assistance with anything else, the configuration file should look like this:

####################
####### CODE #######

{
	Overlay: [
		
	],
	
	Age_of_History: Overlay
}

####### CODE #######
####################


The masks for overlays are placed in the following directory:
map/THE_MAP/background/overlays/high/

The low folder is used only when someone selects “Texture quality: low” in the settings:
map/THE_MAP/background/overlays/low/

To simplify, you can place the same mask images in the low folder as in the high folder.

The high/ folder is the primary directory for the overlay masks.

####

The mask for your map should be a single image.
It does not work like the main map background, which can be split into multiple images.

The mask does not need to have the same dimensions as your main map background.
It only needs to maintain the proportions (scaled down if necessary, for example, if the map background is over 5000 pixels width).

You can use either the full dimensions for the mask or a proportionally scaled version.
The game will automatically scale up the mask.

####

In the Overlays.json file, you specify which mask and overlay tile to draw.

####### CODE #######

		{
			Tile: "plains_tile.png",
			Mask: "plains_mask.png",
			Scale: 0.02,
			Alpha: 0.0,
			AlphaScaleZoomOut: 0.025,
			AlphaScale: 0.275,
			ExtraColor: 1.65,
		},

####### CODE #######

Scale: 0.02,
This is the scale at which the tile will be drawn in the game. A scale of 1.0 represents 100%, while 0.02 corresponds to only 2%.
This is designed this way because when you zoom in, the tile will also be zoomed in.

Alpha: 0.0,
# Minimum alpha value for the tile mask.

AlphaScale: 0.275,
# Determines how much the alpha of the tile increases when zoomed in.

ExtraColor: 1.65,
# Controls the blending of colors (tile + mask). This is why the masks are not just white, but are colored as the map.
