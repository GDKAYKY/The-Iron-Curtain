## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

For your mod the path will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/YOUR_MAP/

#####

You can find an example mod for creating a new map at the following path:

modsExamples/Map_NewMap/

If you want to try it, move the Map_NewMap/ folder from modsExamples/ to mods/, and then run the game.

You can use it as a working ground for your map.
Don't forget to change the name of your mod folder (Map_NewMap) to a new unique one.

#####

If you create or edit a scenario in the game and save it, the game will save the scenario files in the main game directory, not in your mod path (mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/YOUR_MAP/).
The scenario files will be saved in the following location: map/YOUR_MAP/scenarios/.
Therefore, you will need to move the folder with the scenario to your mod directory.

#####


If you are at the beginning of creating your map, to simplify your work, do not place your map in your mod folder.
Instead, temporarily place your map folder in the main game files under map/

You will also need to manually add your map to map/Maps.json for it to be found by the game.

#####

Map Editor:
map/MapEditor_2.jar
map/MapEditorSettings.txt

#####

You don't need to add your map to map/Maps.json if your map is in the mods folder or is from Steam Workshop.
The game will automatically detect your map.

Do not modify the map/Maps.json file! Do not place map/Maps.json in your mod folder!
