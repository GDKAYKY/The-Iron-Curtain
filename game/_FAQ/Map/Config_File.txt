## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

For your mod the path will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/YOUR_MAP/

#####

The game has two Config files.
The main one is Config.json located in the map folder.

ConfigLow.json is only used when the player sets the texture quality to Low.

########################

Lets open the Config.json

########

DefaultMapScale: 2,

## This setting sets the size of the province images generated for each province.
The default value is 1.
To increase the quality, raise the value (integer).
Be careful, higher DefaultMapScale will result in increased VRAM usage and larger file sizes for provinces on the disk.

After you have definied the DefaultMapScale then go to:

YOUR_MAP/data/scales/AvailableScales.txt

In this text file should be the same number that you used for DefaultMapScale.
The integers you enter in this file will instruct the game to generate provinces at those scales.
For example, using:
1;2;4;
will generate provinces at scales 1, 2, and 4.

Example text in the file to generate only the DefaultMapScale:
2;

########

ExtraMapScale: 2.5,

## The next value is for upscaling the provinces in the game. Provinces are scaled to the specified extra scale.
Adjust this value up or down to see how the map appears in the game.
The value is a float.
In this example, it will result in an extra 250%.
This value does not generate province images; all changes occur when the province is rendered.


########

WorldMap: true,

## The map is world map true or false

########

BackgroundSize_X: 8,
BackgroundSize_Y: 4,

## The width of every single image should be the same!
## The height of every single image should be the same!
## The width and height may be different.

Images background path: YOUR_MAP/background/main/

## Example
    BackgroundSize_X: 3,
    BackgroundSize_Y: 2,
    
How many horizontal images and how many vertical images the map background is divided into.
In this example we have 3 horizontal images and two vertical images.

The naming of images:

It will be always: Y_X.png
