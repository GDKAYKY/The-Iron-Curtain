## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

For your mod the path will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/YOUR_MAP/

#####

An additional map background can be displayed in the game when the map is zoomed out.

Mod example:

How to add it:
Go to config file of your map

map/THE_MAP/Config.json
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/YOUR_MAP/Config.json


Inside the file, you can find:

#############

	BackgroundZoomOut_Enable: false,
	BackgroundZoomOut_Size_X: 4,
	BackgroundZoomOut_Size_Y: 2,
	BackgroundZoomOut_Scale: 0.13,

#############


BackgroundZoomOut_Enable: true,
## Set BackgroundZoomOut_Enable: true to enable the zoom-out background.

BackgroundZoomOut_Scale: 0.13,
## This defines the scale at which the game switches from the main map background to the zoomed-out background.
## The value should range from 0.99 to as low as 0.1 (depending on the map!).

BackgroundZoomOut_Size_X: 4,
BackgroundZoomOut_Size_Y: 2,

It works the same as the main map bakcgroudn.

For the main map background in the config file I have used:

BackgroundSize_X: 8,
BackgroundSize_Y: 4,

The numbers may differ, but you can use the same X and Y values as those used for the main map background.

In this case, I used 4 and 2 instead of 8 and 4, like in the main map background, to reduce loading data.
The game automatically scales the zoomed-out background to match the scale of the main background.

## Important!
I recommend using the same X and Y values, as well as the same image sizes for the background, to make it easier for you!

The zoom-out background images are placed in the following path:
map/THE_MAP/background/zoomOut/
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/YOUR_MAP/background/zoomOut/
