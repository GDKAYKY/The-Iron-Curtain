## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####


Go to:
game/units/

## Main file with all unit types: Units.json
Here you add new unit type.

Example: 

		{
			File: "Warior.json",
			ID: 0,

			Line: 0,
		},


Line: 0 - The army will be positioned in the center of the front line of battle.
Line: 1 - The army will be positioned on the flanks of the front line of battle.
Line: 2 - The army will be positioned in the second line of battle.


## Create a new file to define the unit types, along with their respective units and upgrades:

Example file:
Warior.json

This file contains the details of a single unit type and its upgrades.
