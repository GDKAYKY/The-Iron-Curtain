## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

For your mod the path will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/game/characters/

#####

game/characters/

How to create new Character:

Each character has its own unique JSON file (Example: Franklin.json)

##########################

[
{
	Name: "Benjamin Franklin",
	ImageID: Franklin,
	
	BornDay: 17,
	BornMonth: 1,
	BornYear: 1706,
	
	Attack: -1,
	Defense: -1,
},
]

##########################

## Steps to Create a New Character:
Copy and Rename the File:

Copy an existing file (e.g., Franklin.json) and rename it with a unique filename, like Surname.json
Replace "Surname" with the real last name of the character you are creating.


## Set the Character's Name:
The name that will appear in the game is defined in the "Name" field.

Example:
Name: "Benjamin Franklin"


## Attack and Defense Values:
If the values for Attack or Defense are set to -1, the game will assign random values.


## Image Specifications:

The ImageID in the JSON file corresponds to the name of the image file:
ImageID: "Franklin"
So, the image file should be named Franklin.png

## The image dimensions should be 125x125 px
Store the image in this path:

game/characters/H/


Ensure Unique Names:
Both the JSON file and the image file must have unique names to avoid conflicts in the game.

These characters can be used in events or scenarios as special advisors or generals for civilizations within the game.

Using Characters in Scenarios

Locate the Example: Navigate to:
map/Earth3/scenarios/ModernWorld/Characters.json

## Assigning Characters to Your Scenario:

map/THE_MAP/scenarios/YOUR_SCENARIO/


## Example of Characters.json

This example includes three civilizations: Russia, Ukraine, and the United States.

		Administrative: "Medvedev",
		Economic: "Mishustin",
		Innovation: "",
		Military: "Shoigu",
		Generals: [ "Mizintsev", ],
	},


CivTAG: Indicates which civilization will receive these characters (in this case, Russia)

Administrative Advisor: Medvedev
Path: game/characters/Medvedev.json

Economic Advisor: Mishustin
Path: game/characters/Mishustin.json

Innovation Advisor: Left empty.

Military Advisor: Shoigu
Path: game/characters/Shoigu.json

## Generals for Russia
General: Mizintsev
Path: game/characters/Mizintsev.json

If you want to add more starting generals, you can do so like this:
Generals: [ "Zaluzhnyi", "Syrskyi", "Shaptala", "Barhylevych" ],

If you prefer not to add any generals, it will look like this:
Generals: null,

This setup allows you to customize the characters for your scenario effectively.
