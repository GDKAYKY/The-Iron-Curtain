## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

Open the game and navigate to: New Game → Play → Play
While in the game, click the Civilization Flag (located in the top left corner).
Select More → Console

In the console, type a message:
debug

Now, when you hover over a province, the hovered province ID will be displayed.

######

Now that you know the province ID, you can assign a special image to this province.

Image dimensions: 600 px width 192 px height

Name the image after the province ID.
For example, if the province ID is 124, the image should be named 124.png


Add the image to the following directory:
map/Earth3/provinces/

or

mods/YourModName/map/Earth3/provinces/

or

mods/YourModName/map/YouMapName/provinces/
