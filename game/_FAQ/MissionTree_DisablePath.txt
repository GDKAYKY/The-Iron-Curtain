If you would like to create two different mission paths and exclude one of them if the other is chosen, then:

Example:

##############################

First Mission Tree Path:
In this path, Germany declares war on Poland, followed by additional missions specified for that decision.
The ID of the event in this mission will be:
id=GerDeclaresWarOnPol

Second Mission Tree Path:
In this path, Germany forms an alliance with Poland, followed by additional missions specified for that decision.
The ID of the event in this mission will be:
id=GerMakesAllianceWithPol

##############################

In the event's trigger, you should use:
has_variable_not=some_variable

##############################

For the first mission event:
has_variable_not=GerMakesAllianceWithPol

## Adding this will disable the possibility of taking this path if the player has chosen the second path. (Germany forms an alliance with Poland)


For the second mission event:
has_variable_not=GerDeclaresWarOnPol

## Adding this will disable the possibility of taking this path if the player has chosen the second path. (Germany declares war on Poland)


####
## This way, the event(Mission) won't run if the player has already completed a different event(Mission).

##############################

Every time a civilization runs an event and makes a decision, the ID of the event is added to the list of all variables for that civilization.
