## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json,

## How to add a description in the New Game menu for a scenario.


Let's say our scenario tag is: ModernWorld

In the game files, go to:
map/THE_MAP/scenarios/ModernWorld/

In this directory, create a file named: Desc.txt

Inside the Desc.txt file, write the description for your scenario.


Example:
map/Earth3/scenarios/ModernWorld/Desc.txt
