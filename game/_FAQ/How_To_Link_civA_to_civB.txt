## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.

Go to:
game/rulersRandom/link/

Create a text file named with the Civilization tag.(civTag.txt)
For example, use the actual civilization tag from the game: 'pol.txt' for Poland and 'fra.txt' for France

In the file, specify which civilization this civ is linking to by listing the source and target civs


Example use:

anju = Anjou
links to:
fra = France


Create file anju.txt, inside this file write:
fra

That's all!
Now the game for Anjou will read French names and surnames for advisors and generals
