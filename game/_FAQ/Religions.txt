File containing all religions in the game:
game/Religions.json

For your mod the path will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/game/Religions.json


Example code for a single Religion:

###########################################

		{
			Name: Taoism,
			Icon: "taoism.png",
			ReligionGroupID: 4,
			Color: [230, 230, 100],
			Tribal: false,
			
			IncreaseTaxEfficiencyCost: -0.025,
		},

###########################################


Name represents the name of the religion.

Icon refers to the religion's in-game icon.
Images with the corresponding name must be placed in the following folders:

gfx/religion/H/
gfx/religion/XH/
gfx/religion/XXH/

All size scales are required!


ReligionGroupID indicates which other religions have close ties.
For example, Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant are in the same group.
The group plays an important role in gameplay, as it determines whether civilizations will have positive relations with each other.

Color: RGB 0-255

Tribal: true or false,
If true, non-tribal civilizations will attempt to conquer tribal civilizations.

Each religion can have unique bonuses, ranging from none to multiple.
A list of available bonuses for religions can be found here: game/_FAQ/Religion_Bonuses.txt
