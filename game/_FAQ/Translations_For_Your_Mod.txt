## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.

You can add anything that needs to be translated to the translation files: events, buildings, 
technologies, units, legacies, laws, Civilization names, and more!

How to Add Translations for Different Languages to Your Mod

Go to Your Mod Folder:
mods/YourMod/
## Instead 'YourMod' use unique name for YourMod!!

Create a Languages Folder: Inside your mod folder, create a new folder called:
languages

The path for your translations will now be:
mods/YourMod/languages/

#####
Create the Default English Translation File: Inside the languages folder, create a file named:
Bundle.properties

So the full path will look like this:
mods/YourMod/languages/Bundle.properties

This file will serve as your default English translation.
Inside the file, add your translatable text as key-value pairs. Here’s an example for unit names:

###########################

SharkCat = Shark Cat
HomeCat = Home Cat
DadCat = Dad Cat

###########################

The text on the left side (before the =) is the key.
The text on the right side (after the =) is the translation.


####
Add Translations for Other Languages, Example: Polish
To add translations for another language, such as Polish, you’ll need to create a new file in the same languages folder.

All the game’s translation formats can be found in:

game/languages/
From this, you’ll find that Polish translations use '_pl' in the file name.
So, create a new file for Polish:

mods/YourMod/languages/Bundle_pl.properties

Inside this file, provide the Polish translations like this:

###########################

SharkCat = Kot Rekin
HomeCat = Domowy Kot
DadCat = Kot Tata

###########################

You're Done! Now your mod has both English and Polish translations.

For a complete example, check out:

###########################

Do not add translations to the main game translation files!
game/languages/

Use mod-specific translations instead!
mods/YourMod/languages/
