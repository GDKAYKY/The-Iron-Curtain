## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

Go to:
game/gameValues/

If you want to modify any value in a file,
you must copy the entire file to your mod folder and then make your changes in the copied version.

mods/YourModName/game/gameValues/GameValues.json

or

mods/YourModName/game/gameValues/GV_Battle.json

Mod example:
