## This guide explains how to add a ruler to the game

Go to:
game/rulers/

Inside this folder, you will find multiple .json files, each representing rulers for a specific civilization.

For example:
game/rulers/afg.json contains rulers for Afghanistan.
game/rulers/atr.json contains rulers for Austria.
game/rulers/rus.json contains rulers for Russia.

## Locate Civilization tags for your scenario:
To find the list of civilization tags in a specific scenario, go to:
map/THE_MAP/scenarios/THE_SCENARIO/Data.json

## Find all Civilization tags and their names:
Look in the file: game/languages/civilizations/Bundle.properties
Find the entry for Belgium. Its tag will be: bel

#######################################################

Example, Adding a Ruler for Belgium in World War II

From Bundle.properties, we know the Civilization tag for Belgium is: bel

If the file bel.json does not exist, create it, or copy any existing file from the game/rulers/ directory and rename it.
If the file does exist, open it for editing.

Example Structure of Ruler File
For a Single Ruler:

{
	Rulers: [
		{
			Name: "Philippe of Belgium",
			ImageID: 45,
			
			BornDay: 15,
			BornMonth: 4,
			BornYear: 1960,
			
			ReignYear: 2013,
		},
	],

	Age_of_History: Rulers
}

#######################################################

Example, For Multiple Rulers:

{
	Rulers: [
		{
			Name: "Hubert Pierlot",
			ImageID: Pierlot,
			
			BornDay: 22,
			BornMonth: 2,
			BornYear: 1883,
			
			ReignYear: 1934,
		},
		{
			Name: "Philippe of Belgium",
			ImageID: 45,
			
			BornDay: 15,
			BornMonth: 4,
			BornYear: 1960,
			
			ReignYear: 2013,
		},
	],

	Age_of_History: Rulers
}

#######################################################

Important Guidelines

Order by ReignYear:
Rulers must be listed in ascending order of ReignYear, starting from the earliest year to the latest.


## Key Attributes:

BornYear: 1883,
ReignYear: 2013,

ImageID: Pierlot,

####################

## The year of birth must be set accurately, or the ruler will not appear in the game (they cannot be too old or rule before their birth).

## The ReignYear represents the year at which the ruler takes control of the Civilization.

## Unique ImageID:
If the ImageID is Pierlot, the corresponding image file should be named Pierlot.png
Each ruler must have a unique ImageID.



## Ruler Image Specifications:

The ruler's image should be 150x150 pixels.

Save the image in:
game/rulers/rulersImages/H/


Optionally, larger images can be stored in:
game/rulers/rulersImages/XH/
game/rulers/rulersImages/XXH/


This process will ensure that Belgium has a ruler in the game for the World War II scenario, and the rulers are correctly formatted and sorted.
