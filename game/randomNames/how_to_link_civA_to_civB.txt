Go to:
game/rulersRandom/link/

Create a text file named with the Civilization tag.(civTag.txt)
For example, use the actual civilization tag from the game: 'pol.txt' for Poland and 'fra.txt' for France

In the file, specify which civilization this civ is linking to by listing the source and target civs


Example use:

anju = Anjou
links to:
fra = France


Create file anju.txt, inside this file write:
fra

That's all!
Now the game for Anjou will read French names and surnames for advisors and generals
