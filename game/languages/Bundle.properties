# Scenarios

1066Desc1 = Europe witnessed the Norman invasion of England, while empires crumbled in the East - Byzantines faded, Islam fragmented, and Mongols rose.

1618Desc1 = In Europe, the Thirty Years' War was about to begin, a devastating conflict that would embroil much of the continent. It started in the Holy Roman Empire, a loose conglomeration of states, duchies, and principalities under the nominal control of the Habsburg Emperor.
1618Desc2 = Tensions between Catholic and Protestant states had reached a breaking point, and the Defenestration of Prague in May 1618, where two Catholic officials were thrown out of a castle window by Protestant nobles, set the stage for a long and bloody war.
