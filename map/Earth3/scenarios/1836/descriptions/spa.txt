Spain is a nation in turmoil, caught in a bloody civil war and grappling with political and social upheaval. Queen Isabella II, a child of three, sits on the throne, but power struggles between competing factions consume the country. The Carlist War, a brutal conflict between supporters of the queen and those who back her uncle, Don Carlos, rages across the land. Liberal forces, advocating for a constitutional monarchy, fight against the Carlists, who champion absolute monarchy and traditional Catholic values. Madrid, the capital city, is a microcosm of the nation's divisions. Grand palaces stand alongside bombed-out buildings, a testament to the war's devastation. Fear and uncertainty grip the populace, unsure of who will prevail. The economy lies in tatters. The war has drained the treasury, hindering infrastructure projects and crippling trade. Discontent simmers among the working class, who face rising prices and dwindling opportunities. Despite the turmoil, Spain boasts a rich cultural heritage. Artists like Francisco Goya capture the horrors of war in their work, while writers grapple with the nation's turbulent times. Theatrical traditions and vibrant regional customs offer a glimpse into a Spain yearning for peace. Spain in 1836 stands at a crossroads. Can the nation find a way to end the civil war and establish a stable government? Will it embrace a more liberal constitution and address the needs of the working class? Or will the conflict continue to tear the country apart? The answer to this question will determine Spain's path towards modernization and its place in 19th-century Europe.
