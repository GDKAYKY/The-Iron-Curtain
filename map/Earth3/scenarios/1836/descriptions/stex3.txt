Texas in 1836 is a land in flux. The fledgling Republic of Texas, declared just months prior, fights for its independence from Mexico. Battle lines are drawn, with skirmishes and tensions simmering across the territory. The provisional capital moves from city to city, reflecting the precarious situation. Anglos, many recent arrivals from the United States, make up a significant portion of the Texan population. They clash with the Tejanos, Hispanic Texans with deep roots in the land. Both groups are fiercely independent and determined to shape the future of Texas. The vast landscape offers opportunity and danger. Vast ranches dot the central plains, while settlers carve out farms along rivers and near the Gulf Coast. The untamed frontier beckons, but it also harbors dangers â€“ Native American tribes resist encroachment, and Mexican troops pose a constant threat. Despite the hardships, a spirit of resilience defines Texas in 1836. Volunteers pour in from the United States to fight for Texan independence. Newspapers spread the word of the revolution, rallying support for the cause. Texans hold fast to their dream of an independent republic, even as the fight for freedom hangs in the balance.
