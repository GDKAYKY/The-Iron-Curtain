Portugal is a nation emerging from the shadows of political instability. Queen Maria II, a young monarch, recently returned from exile in Brazil, sits on the throne. However, the scars of the Liberal Wars, a bloody civil conflict between supporters of an absolute monarchy and those advocating for a constitutional one, are still fresh. Lisbon, the capital city, bustles with activity as the nation rebuilds. Grand Baroque architecture stands alongside signs of recent battles, a reminder of the conflict's toll. Coffee houses hum with political debate, with citizens eager to shape Portugal's future. The economy remains fragile. Years of war have depleted the treasury, and trade routes are disrupted. Discontent simmers amongst the working class, who face economic hardship with few opportunities for advancement. Large landholdings by the aristocracy remain a source of inequality. Despite the challenges, Portugal boasts a rich cultural heritage. Fado music, with its melancholic melodies and poetic lyrics, captures the national spirit. Exploratory voyages may be a thing of the past, but Portugal's maritime heritage continues to inspire artists and writers. Universities like the University of Coimbra foster intellectual discourse and debate about the nation's future. Portugal in 1836 stands at a crossroads. Can Queen Maria II and her government establish a stable constitutional monarchy and address the needs of the people? Will the nation forge a new path towards economic prosperity? Or will old divisions and social unrest continue to plague the young queen's reign? The answer to this question will determine Portugal's place in 19th-century Europe.
