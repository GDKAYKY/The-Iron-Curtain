Brazil in 1914 is a nation on the rise, brimming with potential but grappling with internal challenges. President Venceslau Brás leads a republic determined to shed its image as a mere exporter of raw materials and embrace modernity. However, social inequalities and a reliance on a single export – coffee – cast shadows over this ambition. Rio de Janeiro, the vibrant capital, pulsates with a unique blend of European influences and burgeoning nationalism. Grand boulevards and newly built theaters showcase aspirations for a modern metropolis, while samba music fills the air, celebrating Brazil's distinct cultural identity. A sense of optimism hangs in the air, fueled by economic growth and a yearning for international recognition. The economy hinges on coffee exports, a lucrative trade that brings wealth to a select few. However, this dependence leaves Brazil vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. Industrialization is in its early stages, and vast swathes of the population, particularly in the rural interior, toil in poverty. Social unrest simmers amongst laborers demanding better wages and working conditions. Brazil initially declares neutrality in the outbreak of World War I. Despite maintaining trade relations with both sides, a sense of solidarity with fellow Latin American nations and the potential for increased coffee exports towards the warring parties nudge Brazil towards a more active role on the global stage. The sinking of Brazilian ships by German U-boats further complicates neutrality and fuels calls for a more assertive foreign policy. Despite its limitations, Brazil boasts a rich cultural heritage. Writers and artists explore themes of national identity and the challenges of modernization. The "Semana de Arte Moderna" (Modern Art Week) of 1922, though still in the future, is a harbinger of a vibrant artistic movement that will challenge European dominance in the cultural sphere. Capoeira, a martial art form with roots in African traditions, thrives, embodying both the physical prowess and the cultural resistance of Afro-Brazilians. Brazil in 1914 stands at a crossroads. Can it maintain neutrality and focus on internal development, or will the pressures of the war and the desire for a more prominent global role push it towards a more active stance? The answer to this question will determine Brazil's path in the coming decades and its emergence as a major player in the 20th century.
