Serbia in 1914 is a nation simmering with ambition and a sense of grievance. King Peter I Karađorđević presides over a young kingdom yearning to expand its influence and unite South Slavs under one banner. This fervent nationalism, however, places Serbia on a collision course with a powerful Austria-Hungary. Belgrade, the energetic capital, throbs with a youthful vibrancy. Grand government buildings stand alongside bustling cafes and theaters, reflecting a society embracing modernity while clinging to its proud heritage. Nationalist fervor runs high, fueled by memories of past struggles against Ottoman rule and dreams of a unified Slavic state. The economy is on the upswing, but challenges remain. Serbia prioritizes military development, straining its resources and hindering investment in infrastructure and agriculture. Social inequalities persist, with a large peasant population yearning for better living conditions. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo by a young Bosnian Serb radical ignites a powder keg. Austria-Hungary accuses Serbia of orchestrating the attack, plunging Europe into World War I. Serbia, despite mobilizing its forces, faces a daunting task against the Austro-Hungarian juggernaut. Despite the looming conflict, Serbia boasts a rich cultural heritage. Writers and artists celebrate the heroism of past Serbian figures and the beauty of the nation's landscapes. The "gusle," a one-stringed instrument, fills the air with melancholic melodies, capturing the spirit of a nation determined to defend its honor. Serbia in 1914 stands at a precipice. Will its nationalistic fervor lead to a wider conflict, or can diplomacy avert disaster? The answer to this question will reshape the map of Europe and set the stage for a brutal and devastating war.
