Greece in 1914 is a nation on the upswing, cautiously emerging from the shadow of Ottoman rule and eager to reclaim its ancient glory. King Constantine I presides over a country that has recently doubled in size thanks to victories in the Balkan Wars. However, territorial disputes with the Ottomans and internal political divisions cloud the horizon. Athens, the historic capital, buzzes with a newfound energy. Archaeological excavations unearth treasures from the classical past, fueling a national pride in Greece's heritage. Grand boulevards and bustling cafes showcase a society in flux, embracing modernity while clinging to its rich history. However, beneath the surface, tensions simmer between supporters of King Constantine, who favors neutrality, and fervent nationalists who advocate for forceful action to liberate remaining Greek populations under Ottoman control. The economy slowly recovers from the Balkan Wars. The influx of new territories brings agricultural resources and trade opportunities, but also the challenge of integrating diverse populations. Social inequalities persist, with a large peasant class yearning for land reform and better living conditions. Labor unrest simmers in growing urban centers, as workers demand better wages and working conditions. Greece finds itself caught in the web of European alliances. While King Constantine leans towards neutrality, Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, a charismatic leader with strong ties to Britain and France, champions joining the Entente powers against the Ottomans. This clash of political visions threatens to destabilize the fragile unity of the nation. Despite the challenges, Greece boasts a vibrant cultural scene. Artists and writers draw inspiration from both the classical era and the ongoing struggle to forge a new national identity. The dream of a "Greater Greece" uniting all Greek populations fuels artistic expression. The spirit of "philotimo" – love of honor – defines the Greek character, fostering resilience and a determination to secure a brighter future. Greece in 1914 stands at a crossroads. Will it maintain neutrality under King Constantine, or will Venizelos' vision of joining the Entente and liberating Ottoman Greeks prevail? The answer to this question will determine Greece's path in the coming years and its role in World War I.
