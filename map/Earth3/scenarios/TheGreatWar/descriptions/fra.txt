France in 1914 is a nation yearning to reclaim its former glory and grappling with the simmering tensions of a post-colonial world. President Raymond Poincar√© leads a republic determined to assert its power on the global stage, but anxieties about a resurgent Germany linger beneath the surface. Paris, the "City of Lights," pulsates with artistic innovation and a sense of national pride. Grand boulevards and iconic landmarks showcase France's cultural influence, while cafes and theaters buzz with lively discussions about art, politics, and the nation's role in the world. However, the scars of the Franco-Prussian War decades earlier fuel a desire for revenge against Germany. The economy flourishes, driven by industry, trade, and a vast colonial empire. French exports range from luxury goods to industrial machinery, solidifying the nation's position as a major economic power. Yet, social inequalities persist, with a growing working class demanding better wages and working conditions, occasionally erupting in strikes and protests. France actively cultivates alliances to counterbalance Germany's growing military might. A strong bond with Russia forms the cornerstone of French foreign policy, aiming to contain German expansionism. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo presents a critical test for these alliances. France, bound by treaty to Russia, stands firmly behind Serbia, setting the stage for a wider European conflict. Despite its anxieties, France boasts a vibrant cultural scene. Impressionist paintings and literary masterpieces by the likes of Proust and Zola capture the essence of French society. Scientific advancements and philosophical movements further enhance France's reputation as a center of intellectual thought. France in 1914 stands at a crossroads. Can it maintain peace through its alliances, or will the assassination in Sarajevo trigger a devastating war in Europe? The answer to this question will determine the fate of millions and reshape the global order for decades to come.
