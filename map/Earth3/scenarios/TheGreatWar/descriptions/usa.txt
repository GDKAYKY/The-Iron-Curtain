The United States in 1914 is a nation on the cusp of change, grappling with its growing global influence and the allure of isolationism. President Woodrow Wilson presides over a country undergoing rapid industrialization and urbanization, but social inequalities and calls for reform simmer beneath the surface. The outbreak of war in Europe presents a critical test for American neutrality. Washington D.C., the bustling capital, embodies the nation's ambition and its internal conflicts. Grand government buildings stand alongside crowded tenements, a stark reminder of the growing gap between rich and poor. Debates rage in Congress about the role the U.S. should play on the world stage. Should it remain aloof from European entanglements, or use its growing economic and military might to shape the global order? The economy thrives on industrial production and innovation. Assembly lines churn out new products, and American exports flood the global market. However, this prosperity is unevenly distributed. Labor unions fight for better wages and working conditions, while Progressive reformers push for social safety nets and regulations to address the harsh realities of industrial life. Despite initial declarations of neutrality, the war in Europe deeply impacts the United States. Public opinion sways between sympathy for the Allies, particularly Britain and France, and a desire to avoid getting embroiled in a costly conflict. Economic ties with the Allies and the sinking of the Lusitania by a German U-boat in 1915 strain American neutrality. Despite the challenges, the United States boasts a vibrant cultural scene. The Harlem Renaissance flourishes, celebrating African American art, literature, and music. Writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway capture the spirit of the times, questioning traditional values and exploring new literary forms. The rise of silent films entertains the masses and reflects a changing society. The United States in 1914 stands at a crossroads. Can it maintain its neutrality and focus on domestic issues, or will the pressures of the war and the desire to uphold its ideals draw it into the global conflict? The answer to this question will determine America's future role as a world power and reshape the course of the 20th century.
