Italy in 1936 is a nation rigidly controlled, draped in the black shirts and iconography of fascism. Benito Mussolini, the "Duce," wields absolute power, his image plastered across buildings and newsreels. Rome, the "Eternal City," undergoes a dramatic transformation. Grandiose architecture in a neo-classical style reflects the regime's obsession with power and its attempts to link itself to the glories of the Roman Empire. Propaganda bombards the population, extolling fascist virtues like obedience and national pride. The economy is tightly controlled by the state, with an emphasis on military production and self-sufficiency. While this approach reduces unemployment, it also limits consumer goods and choices. Individual freedoms are severely curtailed, with dissenters facing imprisonment or exile.Despite the outward displays of unity, tensions simmer beneath the surface. Many Italians, particularly in the north, harbor doubts about the regime's economic policies and aggressive foreign adventures. The growing persecution of Jews and the suppression of religious freedoms further erode public trust. Italy in 1936 stands at a crossroads. Can Mussolini maintain control and deliver on his promises of a glorious fascist empire? Will the Italian people continue to support the regime, or will growing discontent and potential military setbacks lead to its downfall? The answer to this question will determine Italy's role in the looming conflicts that will reshape Europe.
