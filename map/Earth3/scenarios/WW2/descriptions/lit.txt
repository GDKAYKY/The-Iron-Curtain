Lithuania in 1936 faces an uncertain future, caught between the ambitions of larger powers. President Antanas Smetona wields strong control, guiding the nation through a period of consolidation and growing anxieties. Kaunas, the temporary capital, bustles with activity as the government strives to establish a strong national identity. New universities and cultural institutions flourish, promoting Lithuanian language, literature, and traditions. However, anxieties about the future cast a long shadow. Lithuania recently regained independence after a struggle with the Soviet Union, and tensions with its powerful neighbor remain high. Meanwhile, the rise of Nazi Germany in the west raises concerns about potential threats to Lithuanian sovereignty. The economy slowly recovers from the devastation of World War I. Agriculture remains the backbone of the nation, but efforts are underway to promote industrial development. Social tensions simmer, with some yearning for a return to traditional rural life and others eager to embrace modernization. Despite the challenges, a spirit of determination defines the Lithuanian character. Having recently secured independence, Lithuanians fiercely cherish their hard-won freedom. Artists and writers celebrate national identity in their work, while athletes compete internationally to raise the nation's profile. Lithuania in 1936 stands at a crossroads. Can it maintain its independence in the face of pressure from larger powers? Will it successfully navigate the challenges of economic development and social change? The answer to this question will determine Lithuania's path in the coming decades.
