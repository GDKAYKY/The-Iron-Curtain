Belgium in 1936 is a nation grappling with social divisions and international anxieties. King Leopold III, a young monarch, presides over a country still recovering from the scars of World War I. Brussels, the elegant capital, bustles with political activity. Grand government buildings and international institutions like the League of Nations headquarters symbolize Belgium's aspirations for peace and stability. However, tensions simmer beneath the surface. The economy slowly recovers from the war, but social inequalities remain stark. Flemish and Walloon populations, divided by language and culture, often clash over political representation and economic opportunities. Labor unrest simmers, with workers demanding better wages and working conditions. The rise of fascism in neighboring Germany casts a long shadow. Belgium bolsters its defenses and seeks alliances to safeguard its neutrality. Anxieties about potential German aggression fuel debates about national security and the best course of action. Despite the challenges, Belgium boasts a vibrant cultural scene. Surrealist artists like Ren√© Magritte capture the anxieties of the times in their thought-provoking work. Chocolate production, a national treasure, thrives, offering a sweet escape from the harsh realities. Belgium in 1936 stands at a crossroads. Can it maintain its neutrality and navigate the growing tensions in Europe? Will it address internal social divisions and forge a more unified nation? The answer to this question will determine Belgium's fate in the turbulent years leading up to World War II.
