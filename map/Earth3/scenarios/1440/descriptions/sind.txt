Sindh, a fertile wedge of land nestled in the lower Indus Valley, thrives as a vibrant crossroads of trade and culture. Ruled by the Samma Dynasty, the region pulsates with energy. Its crown jewel, Thatta, is a bustling port city teeming with merchants from across the Indian Ocean. Ships laden with spices, textiles, and porcelain arrive from the west, while others filled with grain and handicrafts depart for Southeast Asia. Sindhi artisans are renowned for their beautiful pottery, lacquerware, and intricate embroidery.
