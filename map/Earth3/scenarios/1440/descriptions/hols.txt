Holstein carves out a niche for itself as a northern European territory. Ruled by the Counts of Holstein, it occupies a strategic location near the mouth of the Elbe River. This proximity fosters a strong trade economy, with the city of Kiel a vital port for goods moving between the Baltic Sea and the interior of Europe. Holstein is also an agricultural land, dotted with estates managed by a powerful nobility. The Counts themselves are ambitious, sometimes clashing with neighboring Denmark for influence. Despite these challenges, Holstein thrives as a commercial and agricultural hub, with a future tied to the ever-important Baltic trade routes.
