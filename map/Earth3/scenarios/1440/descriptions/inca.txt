The sun god, Inti, watches over a vast domain. Stone-paved roads snake through the rugged Andes, connecting magnificent cities. Runners, swift as condors, carry messages across the empire. Skilled engineers build intricate suspension bridges, defying treacherous valleys. In Cusco, the heart of the empire, gold gleams in the Temple of the Sun, a testament to Inca power. Sapa Inca, the emperor, clad in colorful feathers, prepares for war. Armies of disciplined warriors, armed with bronze axes and spears, stand ready to expand the borders of this ever-growing empire.
