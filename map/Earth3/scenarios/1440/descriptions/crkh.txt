The Crimean Khanate, a young power on the rise, carves out a niche on the Black Sea. Descendants of Genghis Khan, the fierce Tatar khans rule this independent state. Their formidable cavalry dominates the open steppe, and their capital, Bakhchysaray, is a growing center of trade. Raiding neighboring lands, particularly Lithuania and Muscovy, is a source of wealth and power. However, the Khanate also faces challenges. Internal power struggles can be fierce, and the looming shadow of the Ottoman Empire threatens its future independence. The Crimean Khanate must navigate a complex political landscape to solidify its place on the Black Sea.
