Salzburg is a thriving city in the Holy Roman Empire. A prominent trade center, it sits nestled in the Eastern Alps along the Salzach River. The city is famed for its Gothic architecture, with Salzburg Cathedral dominating the skyline. Prince-Archbishop Sigismund von Schaumburg-KÃ¼fer oversees the city, a man of both political and religious power. The University of Salzburg, established in 1377, attracts scholars from across the region. Beyond its walls, mines produce salt, a valuable commodity that brings wealth to the city.
