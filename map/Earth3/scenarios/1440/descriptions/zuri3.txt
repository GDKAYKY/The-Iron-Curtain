A bustling city-state on the Limmat River, thrumming with trade. Cobblestone streets wind past half-timbered houses, leading to the imposing Grossm√ºnster Cathedral. Guilds hold sway, each with its own meeting house and traditions. Scholars debate at the University, while merchants hawk their wares from overflowing stalls. Power rests with the city council, ever vigilant against rivals and ever eager to expand Zurich's influence.
