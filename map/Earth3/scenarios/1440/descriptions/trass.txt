Transylvania is a rising principality nestled in the heart of Central Europe. Ruled by the ambitious Hunady family, the region is a cultural tapestry. Saxons, Vlachs, Hungarians, and Székely people all contribute to its unique character. Fortified towns like Brașov guard vital trade routes, while the Carpathian Mountains hold rich deposits of precious metals. Though Transylvania acknowledges the Hungarian crown, it enjoys a degree of autonomy. Looking ahead, its future hinges on maintaining this delicate balance and capitalizing on its strategic location and diverse population.
