Waldeck, is a small territory nestled amidst rolling hills and dense forests in the heart of the Holy Roman Empire. Ruled by a count, the land boasts a network of fortified castles that keep watch over villages, farms, and the crucial trade routes that wind through the region. Life revolves around agriculture, with farmers tending fields and vineyards, while skilled artisans ply their trades in the few towns that dot the landscape. The ever-present threat of war hangs in the air, as neighboring lords and powerful cities vie for influence. Religious life is centered on the Catholic Church, with monasteries offering education and solace. Waldeck is a place of tradition, where loyalty to the count and the Church are paramount.
