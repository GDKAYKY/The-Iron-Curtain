Frisia, a region of rugged coastal plains, is a land of hardy people and rich maritime traditions. Its inhabitants are skilled sailors and fishermen, deeply connected to the sea. While under the nominal rule of larger powers, the Frisians maintain a strong sense of independence, often resisting external control. The region's strategic location makes it a vital link in North Sea trade, while also exposing it to the challenges of coastal living and foreign ambitions.
