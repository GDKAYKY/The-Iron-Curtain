Khorasan emerges as a vast and culturally rich region in eastern Iran. Its strategic location at the crossroads of Central Asia and the Middle East contributes to its economic prosperity and political importance. A blend of Persian, Turkic, and Afghan cultures shapes its diverse identity. Under Timurid rule, Khorasan experiences a period of relative stability, allowing for economic growth and cultural flourishing. However, the region's proximity to various nomadic and rival powers necessitates constant vigilance and a strong military presence to protect its wealth and independence.
