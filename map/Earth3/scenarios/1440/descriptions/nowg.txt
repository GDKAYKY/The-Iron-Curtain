Veche, a citizen assembly, shares power with a prince, creating a unique political landscape.

However, tensions simmer with their neighbor, the rising Grand Duchy of Muscovy. Novgorod's future hinges on its ability to navigate this complex political landscape, balancing its independence with the ambitions of its rivals.
