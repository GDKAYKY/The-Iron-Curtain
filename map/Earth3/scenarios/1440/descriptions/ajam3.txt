Ajam, a vast tapestry of cultures and landscapes, stretches across a significant portion of Western Asia. While not a unified state, the region is heavily influenced by Persian language and traditions. Grand cities like Shiraz and Herat serve as centers of art, poetry, and science. Trade routes snake through mountains and deserts, carrying spices, silk, and knowledge between empires.
