Courland carves out a path between giants. A semi-autonomous duchy nestled within the Livonian Order's dominion, it's ruled by the Dukes of Kettler. Courland occupies a strategic location on the Baltic coast, and its main port, Mitau, thrives as a center for trade in amber, timber, and furs. However, the Duchy walks a tightrope. While the Kettlers enjoy some independence, they must also answer to the Livonian Order's authority. The future of Courland hinges on its ability to maintain this delicate balance, navigating the demands of a powerful neighbor while capitalizing on its access to the Baltic Sea and its own natural resources.
