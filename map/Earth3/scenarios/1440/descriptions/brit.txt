Brittany stands as a fiercely independent duchy, its Celtic heritage deeply ingrained. While nominally under French influence, the region retains a strong sense of identity. Its strategic location on the Atlantic coast has made it a target for both English and French ambitions, forcing Brittany to navigate a delicate political balance. With a rich cultural tapestry and a proud spirit, the duchy seeks to protect its sovereignty while thriving as a maritime power.
