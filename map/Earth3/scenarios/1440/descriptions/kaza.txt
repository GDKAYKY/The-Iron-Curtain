The Kazan Khanate, a young Turkic state, emerges on the banks of the Volga River. Founded by breakaway members of the Golden Horde, it carves out a path towards independence. Fierce warriors on horseback form the core of their military, and a wooden kremlin serves as the capital's heart. Trade flourishes, particularly in furs and slaves, enriching the Khanate. However, its future is far from certain. The shadow of the mighty Muscovite state looms large, and internal power struggles can threaten stability. The Kazan Khanate must navigate a delicate path, balancing its desire for autonomy with the need to appease powerful neighbors.
