The Khmer people exist in a transitional period. The once mighty Angkor Empire has fallen, its grand temples standing as silent testaments to a glorious past. Power has shifted south, with rival kingdoms vying for dominance in the region. The Khmer king, based in Lovek, grapples to reassert influence. Despite the political uncertainty, Khmer culture thrives. Theravada Buddhism remains the religion of the people, evident in vibrant monasteries and daily practices. Skilled artisans continue their traditions, producing intricate sculptures and textiles. Trade flourishes along the Mekong River, connecting the Khmer with neighboring states and bringing prosperity. The Khmer people, though navigating a new political landscape, maintain their strong cultural identity and spirit.
