Hildesheim is a thriving walled city, part of the Holy Roman Empire. The imposing St. Mary's Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site today, dominates the skyline with its Romanesque architecture and towering spire. Cobbled streets bustle with merchants, artisans, and farmers bringing their goods to market. Skilled silversmiths ply their trade, their workshops echoing with the clang of hammer on metal. The scent of brewing beer fills the air from local establishments, while the aroma of freshly baked bread emanates from bakeries.
