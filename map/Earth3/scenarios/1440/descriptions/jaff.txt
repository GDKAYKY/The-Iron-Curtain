Jaffna, a Tamil kingdom nestled on the northern peninsula of Sri Lanka, carves out a niche for itself. Despite its limited size, Jaffna thrives as a regional trading center. Ships laden with spices, pearls, and elephants call at its bustling port. The kingdom boasts a rich cultural heritage, evident in its Hindu temples and vibrant traditions. However, Jaffna faces challenges. It exists in the shadow of the rising Kotte kingdom in the south, and maintaining independence requires careful diplomacy.
