The Papal States are a complex entity, balancing the roles of spiritual leader of the Catholic world with that of a temporal ruler. The Pope's dominion stretches across central Italy, encompassing Rome and its surrounding territories. While the Papacy wields immense spiritual authority, maintaining control over the Papal States is a constant challenge, with internal strife, external threats, and the ambitions of Italian city-states posing significant risks. The Church's wealth and influence are considerable, but so too are the burdens of governance and defense.
