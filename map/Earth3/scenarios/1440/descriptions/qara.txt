The Qara Qoyunlu, a Turkmen confederation, emerge as a significant power in western Asia. These "Black Sheep Turkmen" feared for their mounted warriors and ruthless tactics, carve out a domain stretching from Armenia to eastern Anatolia. They are a formidable force, adept at lightning raids and wielding power through a mix of military might and strategic alliances. Cities like DiyarbakÄ±r thrive under their rule, benefiting from trade flowing along vital routes. However, the Qara Qoyunlu face challenges. Their control is not absolute, with local rulers sometimes chafing under their authority. Additionally, tensions simmer with their Turkmen rivals, the Ak Koyunlu, or "White Sheep Turkmen," threatening to erupt into open conflict. The Qara Qoyunlu's future hinges on their ability to maintain internal unity, outmaneuver their rivals, and solidify their hold on a strategically valuable region.
