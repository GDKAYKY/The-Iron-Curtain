The Golden Horde, once a vast empire, grapples with a changing world. Rulership is divided between the western and eastern wings, a reflection of internal tensions. Its grip on power weakens as subject states chafe under tribute demands. Cities like Sarai, once grand centers of trade, now face a more uncertain future. Despite its fading glory, the Golden Horde still commands a formidable cavalry force. However, its future hinges on a critical decision: cling to its past dominance or adapt to a new political landscape where its once-feared reputation is slowly fading.
