Mahra exists as a coastal region in southern Arabia, bordering the Indian Ocean. Its proximity to the sea fosters a culture intertwined with maritime activities. A blend of Arab and indigenous traditions shapes its identity. Governed by local sultans or chieftains, the region maintains a degree of autonomy while facing external pressures from larger powers. The challenges of desert life and the allure of maritime trade define the character of Mahra and its people.
