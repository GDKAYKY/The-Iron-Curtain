The Palatinate, a sprawling territory in the Holy Roman Empire, is a patchwork of principalities ruled by the Wittelsbach dynasty. A land of rich farmland and strategic waterways like the Rhine River, the Palatinate enjoys a strong economy. Heidelberg, a jewel of the region, boasts a prestigious university and a magnificent castle. However, the Palatinate's power is fragmented due to its division among various Wittelsbach branches, sometimes leading to internal conflict. Despite this, the region remains a significant player in the political landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.
