Morocco, a powerful North African sultanate, is a crossroads of cultures and trade. The Marinid dynasty rules over a vast territory, balancing internal politics with external threats. The kingdom's strategic position on the Atlantic coast offers opportunities for maritime expansion, while the constant pressure from Christian powers in the Iberian Peninsula demands vigilance. Economic prosperity and religious fervor shape Moroccan society as it navigates the complexities of the medieval world.
