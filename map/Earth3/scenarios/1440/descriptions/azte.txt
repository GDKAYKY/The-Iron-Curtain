Tenochtitlan's heart beats strong. The Templo Mayor, a towering pyramid, pierces the sky. Canoes laden with tribute glide across shimmering Lake Texcoco. Eagle warriors train relentlessly, their obsidian blades glinting in the sun. Priests in turquoise headdresses perform elaborate rituals, appeasing the gods and ensuring the empire's continued dominance. Moctezuma I, a shrewd ruler, expands Aztec influence through conquest and complex alliances. Fear and awe mingle in the air, as the Aztec Empire reaches the zenith of its power.
