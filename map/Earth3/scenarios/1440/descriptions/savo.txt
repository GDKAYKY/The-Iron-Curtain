Savoy is a strategically positioned Alpine state, balancing between France and Italy. The Duchy has grown in influence under the House of Savoy, but its position is precarious. With territories on both sides of the Alps, Savoy must carefully navigate its foreign relations to preserve its independence while expanding its influence. The regionâ€™s mountainous terrain offers both challenges and opportunities, as it protects the duchy from invasion but also limits its agricultural potential.
