The Timurid Empire, once a fearsome juggernaut, casts a long shadow of its former glory. Founded by the ferocious conqueror Timur, it stretched from Anatolia to India. Now, a mere generation after his death, cracks appear in the facade. Descendants of Timur vie for power, leading to internal struggles that weaken the empire's grip on its vast territories. Despite this turmoil, the Timurid legacy endures. Imposing cities like Samarkand still flourish, centers of learning and artistic brilliance. The remaining Timurid rulers are patrons of the arts and sciences, sponsoring magnificent mosques and renowned astronomers. However, the empire's future is uncertain.
