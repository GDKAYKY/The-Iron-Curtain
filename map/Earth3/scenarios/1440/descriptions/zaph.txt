Zaporizhia exists on the fringes of civilization, a wild frontier on the Dnieper River. Cossacks, a band of free-spirited warriors, call this untamed land home. They live by their own code, skilled fighters who hunt, fish, and raid for survival. The vast steppe rolls on for miles, dotted with their semi-permanent settlements. Zaporizhia is a lawless realm, a refuge for those seeking escape from established powers. However, its future is uncertain. The expanding Lithuanian Grand Duchy and the rising power of the Crimean Khanate both cast their eyes on this strategic region.
