Ruppin Castle, perched on a hill, serves as the seat of the powerful Count of Lindow-Ruppin. Surrounding the castle, farms till the fertile lands, while in nearby villages, skilled artisans produce woolen cloth, a source of income for the county. The strategic location along trade routes, particularly the Havel River, fosters a sense of dynamism in the region. However, Ruppin also faces challenges. The ongoing instability within Brandenburg casts a shadow, and the county itself is sometimes embroiled in disputes with its neighbors.
