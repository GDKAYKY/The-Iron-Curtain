A simmering volcano in the fragmented landscape of Japan. A modest castle, perched on a strategic hilltop, houses a family yearning for greater power. Ambitious whispers echo in spartan halls. Young warriors train relentlessly, honing their skills for the battles to come. The Oda, hungry for influence, bide their time, waiting for the right moment to erupt and claim their place in the ever-shifting balance of power.
