Lithuania reigns as the largest European state, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The Grand Dukes, recently elevated to power, navigate a complex political landscape. While Catholicism gains a foothold, many cling to their pagan traditions. The vast plains teem with agriculture, while noble families hold considerable sway in their fortified castles. Lithuania faces challenges: tensions simmer with the Teutonic Knights, and forging a unified identity across its sprawling lands proves a constant struggle. However, Lithuania's future holds promise, its size and resources making it a major player on the European stage.
