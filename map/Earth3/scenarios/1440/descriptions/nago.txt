The Nogai Horde stands as a formidable nomadic confederation on the vast Eurasian steppe. Descendants of the Golden Horde, they maintain a powerful cavalry force, capable of swift raids and conquests. Their nomadic lifestyle, centered around livestock herding, shapes their culture and economy. The Hordeâ€™s strategic position between the Russian principalities, the Crimean Khanate, and the emerging Ottoman Empire demands constant vigilance and adaptability. Balancing internal cohesion with external pressures is crucial for the Nogai to maintain their dominance on the steppe.
