A Gaelic lordship on the rugged southwestern coast of Ireland. Fierce independence burns bright under the rule of the Earl of Desmond. Forests cloak ancient stone forts, while windswept cliffs crash against the sea. Farmers tend their fields, wary of raids. Bards weave tales of warriors and heroes. A harsh land, fiercely defended, steeped in tradition and Celtic lore.
