Sweden grapples with internal struggles. King Christopher of Bavaria, recently elected, faces the challenge of uniting the Kalmar Union with Denmark and Norway. The powerful Swedish nobility presents a significant obstacle to centralized rule. Despite these difficulties, Sweden boasts a strong economy fueled by timber, iron ore, and copper exports. Trade thrives in port cities like Stockholm, a vital hub on the Baltic Sea. Sweden's future hinges on its ability to navigate internal politics and external pressures, while leveraging its natural resources to solidify its position on the European stage.
