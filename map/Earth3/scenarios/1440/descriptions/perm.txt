Perm carves out a niche in the vast wilderness of northeastern Europe. This fur-trading outpost, nestled on the Kama River, is a vital tributary of the mighty Volga. Trappers brave the harsh winters, bringing in pelts of sable and fox that fetch high prices from merchants across Eurasia. The city itself is a mix of wooden structures and a grand kremlin, a fortified enclosure reflecting Perm's growing importance. Though life here is untamed, Perm thrives as a center of trade and a gateway to the fur riches of the north. However, its future hinges on maintaining good relations with the powerful Grand Duchy of Muscovy, whose influence looms ever larger.
