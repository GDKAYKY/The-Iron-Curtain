Karaman, a beylik nestled in south-central Anatolia, carves out a precarious path. Ruled by the Karamanid dynasty, it enjoys a period of relative prosperity.

The future of Karaman hinges on its ability to maintain internal unity, forge strategic alliances, and potentially appease the Ottomans. Can they preserve their independence or will they be absorbed by their increasingly powerful neighbor?
