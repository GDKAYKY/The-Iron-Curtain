A blend of Slavic and Eastern Orthodox cultures shapes its identity. While under the shadow of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the encroaching Mongol influence, Chernigov retains a sense of its glorious past as part of Kievan Rus. The principality's resilience and adaptability are crucial for survival and prosperity in this challenging era.
