Naxos, the largest island of the Cyclades, stands as a prominent maritime power in the Aegean Sea. Its fertile lands and strategic location have fostered a thriving economy based on agriculture and trade. As a duchy under Venetian rule, Naxos benefits from the protection and resources of its powerful overlord. Yet, the island retains a unique identity and a degree of autonomy, allowing it to flourish as a cultural and commercial center.
