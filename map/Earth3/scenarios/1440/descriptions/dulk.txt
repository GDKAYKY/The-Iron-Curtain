Dulkadirids, a Turkmen beylik centered in southeastern Anatolia, carves out a space for itself amidst regional powers. Ruled by the Dulkadir clan, they are skilled warriors and shrewd diplomats. Their capital, Mara≈ü, strategically located on trade routes, bustles with commerce. Caravans laden with goods like spices and textiles bring prosperity, while the surrounding countryside provides agricultural bounty. However, the Dulkadirids tread a careful path. The Mamluk Sultanate to the south and the rising Ottomans to the west exert influence, and maintaining good relations with both is crucial. The Dulkadirids also face challenges from nomadic Turkmen tribes within their own domain.
