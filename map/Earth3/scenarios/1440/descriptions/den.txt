Denmark reigns as a Scandinavian kingdom with ambitions for expansion. King Christopher of Bavaria, recently elected, seeks to consolidate power and unify the Kalmar Union, a three-kingdom alliance with Sweden and Norway. Trade flourishes in port cities like Copenhagen, while the nobility maintains a strong grip on the fertile Danish countryside. Denmark's future hinges on its ability to navigate internal politics and external threats, including potential rivals like the Hanseatic League.
