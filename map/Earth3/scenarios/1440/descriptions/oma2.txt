A blend of Arab and Bedouin cultures shapes its identity. The region's rugged coastline and interior deserts pose challenges, yet its people have adapted, developing a resilient and seafaring lifestyle. Oman's control of key coastal fortresses and its naval prowess enable it to compete for influence in the region and beyond.
