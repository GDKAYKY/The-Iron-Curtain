Muscovy, a rising power on the Eastern European stage, throws off the shackles of the Golden Horde's rule. Grand Prince Vasily II, nicknamed "the Dark" for enduring internal struggles, now seeks to expand his influence. Moscow, the growing capital, is a fortified center of power, home to the Kremlin and a testament to the Prince's ambition. The vast Russian lands hold rich fur reserves, a valuable commodity that fuels trade and brings prosperity. However, Muscovy faces challenges. Internal rivalries simmer, and threats from Lithuania and nomadic raiders linger. Despite these hurdles, Muscovy's future is on the upswing, poised to become a major force in shaping the Eastern European landscape.
