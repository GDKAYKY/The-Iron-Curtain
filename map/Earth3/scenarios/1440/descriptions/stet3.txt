A bustling port city where the Oder River meets the Baltic Sea. Ships laden with goods from across Europe crowd the harbor, their masts a forest against the sky. Sturdy warehouses line the waterfront, storing everything from herring and amber to grain and timber. Merchants from the Hanseatic League mingle with local traders in the bustling marketplace. The imposing Ducal Castle, a symbol of Pomeranian power, overlooks the city. Craftsmen in workshops hammer out metal and carve intricate figures from wood. Stettin thrives as a crossroads of trade, a dynamic center where the salty tang of the sea mingles with the scent of commerce and the spirit of exploration.
