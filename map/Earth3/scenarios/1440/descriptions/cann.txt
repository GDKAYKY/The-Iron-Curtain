Candar, a beylik clinging to the northwestern coast of Anatolia, navigates a turbulent sea. Once a powerful maritime state, its influence wanes as the Ottomans rise in the east. The capital, Kastamonu, still boasts a legacy of shipbuilding and trade. Merchants bring goods like alum and carpets to bustling markets, but the flow of commerce pales in comparison to its former glory. Internally, the beylik grapples with instability. Rival factions vie for control, weakening Candar's ability to resist Ottoman pressure. The future of Candar hinges on its ability to either forge a strong central leadership or carve out a niche within the growing Ottoman sphere of influence. Can they maintain some degree of autonomy or will they be absorbed by their increasingly powerful neighbor?
