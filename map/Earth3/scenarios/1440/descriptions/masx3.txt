Massa emerges as a coastal town within the vibrant region of Tuscany. Its proximity to the sea offers opportunities in fishing and trade, contributing to its modest economy. Governed under the Malaspina family, the town seeks to balance its autonomy with the broader political landscape of Italy. While overshadowed by larger city-states, Massa possesses a unique charm and plays a role in the region's intricate web of alliances and rivalries.
