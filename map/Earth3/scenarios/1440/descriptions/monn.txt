Mongolia exists in a state of flux. The once mighty Mongol Empire has fractured into various Khanates vying for dominance on the vast steppe. Nomadic pastoralism remains the lifeblood of the people, with herders following seasonal migrations for their livestock. Skilled horsemanship and archery define their way of life. Trade routes snake across the grasslands, connecting Mongolia with neighboring powers, bringing both opportunity and conflict. Despite the political disunity, a shared Mongol identity persists, with a rich oral tradition keeping memories of past glories alive.
