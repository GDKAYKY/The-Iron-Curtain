Alaiye, a strategically important port city on the southern coast of Anatolia, thrives as a center of trade and a crossroads of cultures. For centuries, it's been known by various names, including Ayas and Seleukeia. Now, under the control of the Karamanid dynasty, it serves as a vital link between the inland regions and the Mediterranean Sea. Ships laden with spices, timber, and alum from the surrounding mountains fill the harbor, while merchants from across Europe and the Middle East mingle in the bustling marketplace. Despite its prosperity, Alaiye faces an uncertain future. The growing Ottoman Empire casts a long shadow, and the threat of conflict simmers. Maintaining good relations with the Karamanids is essential, but Alaiye's strategic location also makes it a tempting target for any power seeking to control the eastern Mediterranean trade routes. The city's future hinges on its ability to navigate this complex political landscape, balancing its economic importance with the ever-present realities of regional power struggles.
