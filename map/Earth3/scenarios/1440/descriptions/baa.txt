Brandenburg is a margraviate in the Holy Roman Empire yearning for stability. A new ruler, Frederick II Iron Tooth of Hohenzollern, has just ascended the throne, inheriting a realm divided into three Marches – Old, Middle, and New – each with its own set of problems. Powerful nobles and restless towns constantly test Frederick's authority. Despite these internal struggles, Brandenburg possesses potential for growth. Trade routes along the Elbe River bring wealth, and the margraviate enjoys a strategic position near the Baltic Sea. With a determined leader focused on centralization, Brandenburg is poised to transform into a regional powerhouse.
