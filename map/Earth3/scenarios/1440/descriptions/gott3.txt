Göttingen is a modest town, part of the Holy Roman Empire. A small river, the Leine, winds through the town center. The atmosphere is one of scholarly pursuits, with the University of Göttingen established just a few years prior in 1437. Brick Gothic architecture dominates, with the central market square bustling with merchants and traders. The town walls provide a sense of security, with watchtowers offering panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. Religious life is a cornerstone of the community, with the St. James Church serving as a spiritual center. Blacksmiths' hammers ring out, and cobblers mend footwear in their workshops. Students in simple robes hurry to lectures, eager to absorb knowledge. Evenings bring a sense of community, with families gathering around hearths and storytelling captivating audiences in the local taverns.
