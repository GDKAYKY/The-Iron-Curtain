Andorra exists as a small, mountainous principality nestled in the Pyrenees. Its strategic location between the kingdoms of Aragon and France offers both opportunities and challenges. The region's isolation and rugged terrain contribute to a unique way of life, centered around pastoralism and subsistence agriculture. While under nominal suzerainty of the Count of Foix, Andorra maintains a degree of autonomy, preserving its distinct cultural identity. The principality's strategic value as a borderland region is balanced by the challenges of its isolated geography.
