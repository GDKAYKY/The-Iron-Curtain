Picardy stands as a fertile and prosperous region in northern France. Its proximity to the English Channel offers opportunities for trade and fishing. A blend of Celtic and Frankish heritage shapes its identity, while its agricultural wealth sustains its population. As part of the French crown, Picardy contributes to the kingdom's strength and prosperity. The region's strategic location, however, exposes it to the constant threat of invasion, demanding vigilance and resilience from its inhabitants.
