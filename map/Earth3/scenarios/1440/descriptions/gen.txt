Geneva, a city-state nestled at the confluence of the Rh√¥ne and Arve rivers, is a vital trading hub. Its strategic location has fostered a vibrant economy and a strong sense of independence. Surrounded by powerful neighbors, Geneva must navigate a delicate balance of diplomacy and military preparedness to protect its sovereignty. While the city is renowned for its watchmaking and other crafts, its political future is uncertain as it faces pressures from both the Duchy of Savoy and the Swiss Confederation.
