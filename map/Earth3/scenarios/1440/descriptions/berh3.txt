Berchtesgaden nestles in the Bavarian Alps, a picturesque village known for its salt mines. These mines are a source of wealth for the region, and the Benedictine Berchtesgaden Abbey, a powerful landowner, oversees much of the operation. The village itself is a quiet place, surrounded by stunning mountain scenery. Life here revolves around a mix of religious devotion, mining activity, and the beauty of the natural world.
