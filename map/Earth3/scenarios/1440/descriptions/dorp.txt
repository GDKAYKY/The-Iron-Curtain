Dorpat pulsates as a center of faith and commerce in Livonia. A Bishopric, wielding both religious and worldly power, governs the city. Its towering cathedral soars skyward, a symbol of the Bishop's authority and the city's importance. Bustling markets overflow with goods brought by merchants traveling along vital trade routes that converge on Dorpat. Farms and estates controlled by the Bishopric surround the city, funneling wealth into its coffers. However, whispers of discontent occasionally rise, as some chafe under the Bishop's rule. Dorpat's future hinges on maintaining a balance between religious authority, trade, and the desires of its inhabitants.
