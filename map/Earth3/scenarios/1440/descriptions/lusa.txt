Lusatia, a region divided between the Bohemian crown and the Margraviate of Meissen, exists in a state of flux. While the Bohemian side enjoys a certain level of autonomy, the Meissen influence is growing. Lusatian nobles, both German and Slavic, navigate this complex political landscape, seeking to preserve their power. The region holds economic value due to its cloth production and trade routes, particularly Via Regia, the "King's Road." Cities like GÃ¶rlitz and Bautzen serve as important centers of commerce. Despite facing pressures from both sides, Lusatian culture endures, with a unique language and traditions.
