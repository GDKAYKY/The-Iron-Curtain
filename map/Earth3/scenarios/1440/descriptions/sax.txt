Saxony, a patchwork of duchies and margraves in the Holy Roman Empire, is a region on the rise. Rich deposits of silver ore fuel its growing wealth, with cities like Freiberg emerging as mining centers. The Wettin dynasty holds significant influence, and Frederick II the Gentle, the Elector of Saxony, is a powerful figure in regional politics. Universities in Leipzig and Wittenberg draw scholars, fostering a culture of learning. Despite internal divisions between the Ernestine and Albertine Wettin lines, Saxony is poised for future consolidation and growing importance.
