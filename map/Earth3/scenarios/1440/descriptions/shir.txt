Shirvan carves out a niche for itself on the Caspian Sea, a vibrant trading hub nestled in what is now Azerbaijan. Ruled by the Shirvanshahs, a hereditary dynasty, the region boasts a rich cultural heritage. Shamakhi, the capital, is a bustling center of commerce, where merchants from across Eurasia gather to trade in silk, spices. The Shirvanshahs themselves are patrons of the arts and sciences, and their magnificent palace in Baku stands as a symbol of their power and prosperity. However, Shirvan faces challenges. Both the expanding Timurid Empire and the aggressive Kara Koyunlu Turkmen confederation cast a watchful eye, and maintaining independence requires careful diplomacy. Shirvan's future hinges on its ability to navigate this complex political landscape, balancing trade and cultural flourishing with the need to appease powerful neighbors.
