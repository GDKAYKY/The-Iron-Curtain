Münster, a city in the heart of Westphalia, is a significant religious and commercial center. As a Prince-Bishopric, it enjoys a degree of autonomy while being influenced by the Holy Roman Empire. The city’s strategic location on the trade routes contributes to its economic prosperity. However, like many regions in the Holy Roman Empire, Münster faces challenges such as internal strife and external threats, requiring careful diplomacy and governance.
