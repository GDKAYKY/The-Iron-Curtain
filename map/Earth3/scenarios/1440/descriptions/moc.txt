Monaco is a small, fortified principality on the Mediterranean coast. Its strategic location has made it a target for various powers throughout history. Under the Grimaldi family, the principality strives to maintain its independence while navigating the complex political landscape of the region. The principality's survival depends on its ability to balance its relationship with larger states, such as Genoa and France, while also developing its own economic resources.
