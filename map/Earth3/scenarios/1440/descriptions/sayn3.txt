Sayn is a small but strategically important town nestled on the banks of the Rhine river in the County of Sayn, part of the Holy Roman Empire. Its imposing medieval castle, perched on a hilltop, looms over the town, serving as both a residence for the Counts of Sayn and a vital element of the town's defenses. Half-timbered houses with thatched roofs line the narrow streets, bustling with activity. Blacksmiths rhythmically swing their hammers, ringing out a steady beat. Local merchants hawk their wares in the marketplace, offering everything from fresh produce to hand-crafted goods.
