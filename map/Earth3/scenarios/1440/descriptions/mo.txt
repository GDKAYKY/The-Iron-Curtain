1440 finds Moldavia carving its own path on the edge of empires. An independent principality nestled between the Carpathian Mountains and the Black Sea, it's ruled by the ambitious Moldavian voievodes. Life here revolves around agriculture, with fertile plains yielding bountiful harvests. Trade flourishes, particularly in Jassy, a key center for goods moving between Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Moldavia jealously guards its autonomy, facing threats from both Hungary and the Ottomans. The future of this young principality hinges on its ability to maintain its independence through diplomacy or military might.
