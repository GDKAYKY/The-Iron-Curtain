Metz is a prosperous city on the Moselle River, strategically located at the crossroads of France and the Holy Roman Empire. Its position has made it a vital center for trade and commerce. As part of the Duchy of Lorraine, Metz benefits from a degree of autonomy while also facing the challenges of being a borderland region. The city's rich cultural heritage and economic vitality make it a desirable prize for both France and the Empire, requiring careful diplomacy to maintain its independence.
