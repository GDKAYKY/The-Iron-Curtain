Lorraine is a strategically important duchy situated between France and the Holy Roman Empire. Its rich lands and strategic location make it a coveted prize for both powers. While nominally under the French crown, Lorraine maintains a degree of autonomy and a distinct identity. The region's prosperity is tied to agriculture, trade, and its position as a crossroads between major European powers. However, the constant threat of conflict and the competing interests of its powerful neighbors create a complex and uncertain environment for the duchy.
