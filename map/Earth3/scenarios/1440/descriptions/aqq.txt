The Aq Qoyunlu, also known as the "White Sheep Turkmen," stir on the eastern Anatolian steppe. This Turkmen confederation, rivals of the Qara Qoyunlu, gathers strength under their charismatic leaders. Skilled horsemen and adept at warfare, they dream of expanding their influence westward. For now, they bide their time, building alliances and waiting for the opportune moment to challenge the dominant Qara Qoyunlu. Centers like DiyarbakÄ±r, with its bustling markets, lie within reach, tempting prizes in the coming struggle. The Aq Qoyunlu's future hinges on their ability to unite disparate tribes, exploit Qara Qoyunlu weaknesses, and seize the initiative in what promises to be a brutal contest for regional dominance. Their ambition and strategic maneuvering could reshape the political landscape of western Asia.
