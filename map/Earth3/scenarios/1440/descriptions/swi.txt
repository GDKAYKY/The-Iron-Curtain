Switzerland is a nascent confederation of independent cantons, emerging from the Holy Roman Empire. While geographically small, the Swiss have proven to be formidable defenders of their independence.

Despite these challenges, the Swiss are building a reputation as skilled mercenaries and are gradually asserting their sovereignty on the European stage.
