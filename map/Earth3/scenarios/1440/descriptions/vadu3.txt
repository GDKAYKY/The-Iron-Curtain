The County of Vaduz is a minor territory nestled in the Alps. Its mountainous terrain and relative isolation contributed to its limited political and economic significance. Under the Holy Roman Empire, the county was governed by local nobility, often subject to the influence of more powerful neighboring states. Despite its small size, Vaduz possessed a distinct identity and a strong sense of community among its inhabitants.
