The Livonian Order, a stern brotherhood of warrior monks, stands as the northern arm of the Teutonic Knights. The Livonian Brothers control trade routes and convert the local population to Catholicism, facing resistance from some who cling to their pagan beliefs. However, tensions rise within the Order itself, and growing unrest amongst the people they rule threatens their grip on power. The Livonian Order navigates a precarious path, caught between maintaining control and adapting to the shifting political landscape.
