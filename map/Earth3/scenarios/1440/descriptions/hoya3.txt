Hoya carves out a niche for itself as a small county within the Holy Roman Empire. Ruled by the Counts of Hoya, the region centers around the strategically placed Hoya Castle. Despite its modest size, Hoya plays a role in regional trade thanks to its location on the Weser River. Farming dominates the surrounding lands, while skilled artisans contribute to the local economy. The Counts themselves navigate a complex web of alliances, sometimes aligning with neighboring powers like Bremen to secure their position. Hoya's future lies in its ability to maintain its autonomy and capitalize on its strategic location and agricultural resources.
