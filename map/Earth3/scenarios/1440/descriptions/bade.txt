A margraviate ruled from hilltop castles, nestled in the Holy Roman Empire. Vineyards and farms sprawl in the Rhine valleys, while the Black Forest bristles with trees. Trade flows through, monks offer solace, and nobles answer to the margrave. A land of commerce and power, with a watchful eye on its neighbors.
