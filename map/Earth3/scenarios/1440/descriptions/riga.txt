Riga bustles as a major trading hub within the Livonian Order's grasp. This strategic city sits at the mouth of the Daugava River, a vital gateway for commerce between east and west. The imposing Riga Castle, headquarters of the Livonian Brothers, looms over the city, a symbol of their power. Merchants from across Europe fill the marketplace, while the harbor teems with activity as ships laden with furs, flax, and wax arrive and depart. However, beneath the surface of prosperity, tensions simmer. The Livonian Order's strict rule and attempts to convert the population to Catholicism spark discontent. Riga's future hinges on its ability to balance the demands of the Order with the desires of its inhabitants, while maintaining its position as a thriving commercial center.
