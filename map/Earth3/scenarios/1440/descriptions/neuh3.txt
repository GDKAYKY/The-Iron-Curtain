Neuchâtel is a county located in the western part of what would later become Switzerland. It is a region characterized by its rolling hills and proximity to the Jura Mountains. While nominally under Burgundian influence, Neuchâtel is increasingly drawn to the Swiss Confederation, offering a potential path towards greater independence and security. The county's strategic location and its growing prosperity make it a coveted prize for neighboring powers, requiring careful diplomacy to preserve its autonomy.
