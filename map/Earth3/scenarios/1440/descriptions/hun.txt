Hungary stands as a powerful kingdom in Central Europe, a realm reaching its peak. King Vladislaus I rules from Buda, a magnificent capital city. The vast Hungarian Plain provides fertile land for agriculture, while the Carpathian Mountains hold rich mineral deposits. Nobles wield considerable power throughout the kingdom, their grand castles dotting the landscape. Hungary is a land of cultural diversity, with Hungarians, Germans, Slavs, and Romanians living side-by-side. Despite facing threats from the ever-present Ottoman Empire, Hungary remains a force to be reckoned with in Europe.
