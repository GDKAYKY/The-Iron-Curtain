A patchwork of duchies and principalities nestled in Central Europe. Towering castles pierce the sky, watching over fertile valleys and dense forests. Farmers tend their fields, while miners delve deep for silver, copper, and tin. Trade routes snake through the region, carrying goods from the Baltic to the south. Towns bustle with merchants, artisans ply their crafts, and guilds hold sway. Silesia, a land rich in resources and tradition, exists in a delicate balance between regional powers â€“ the Kingdom of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire, and the emerging Jagiellonian dynasty.
