A free imperial city nestled in the foothills of the Alps. Imposing walls enclose a maze of cobbled streets, bustling with merchants and artisans. The renowned Imperial Abbey, a powerful religious and political entity, shares the city with the independent townsfolk. Skilled craftsmen produce everything from textiles to metalwork, catering to both the abbey's needs and the city's trade. A vibrant marketplace overflows with goods, while scholars debate within the abbey's walls. Life in Kempten walks a tightrope between the authority of the Church and the burgeoning independence of the city, creating a unique blend of piety and ambition.
