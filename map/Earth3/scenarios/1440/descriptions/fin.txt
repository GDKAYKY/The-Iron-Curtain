Finland exists as a northern territory under Swedish rule. Its vast forests, numerous lakes, and long coastline shape a distinctive identity. A blend of Finnish and Swedish cultures coexist, with Swedish influence gradually increasing. The region's strategic location, bordering Russia, demands constant vigilance and a strong defense. While primarily agrarian, Finland's potential for trade and maritime activities is recognized, contributing to the kingdom's overall prosperity. The challenges of a harsh northern climate are balanced by the region's natural resources and the resilience of its people.
