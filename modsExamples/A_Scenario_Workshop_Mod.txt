## Read: mods_steam_workshop.txt !
## 
## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##
#####

For your mod the path will be:
mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/MAP_NAME/scenarios/

## How to Share Your Scenario as a Mod on the Steam Workshop
#####

By default, scenarios created in the scenario editor will be saved in:

map/MAP_NAME/scenarios/
map/Earth3/scenarios/

The folder name of the scenario will correspond to the tag of the scenario!

#####

Creating a mod folder:
You can copy the folder named '_EmptyFoldersScenario' from modsExamples/ to the mods/ folder.
After copying, rename '_EmptyFoldersScenario' to a unique name for your mod.
For example: U_MyName_1037_Scenario

Now you can set the mod name and description in the mod.txt file, and change logo.png to your modâ€™s logo

#####

To create a mod that shares this scenario, copy the folder with the scenario tag to the path:

mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/MAP_NAME/scenarios/
Example:
mods/U_MyName_1037_Scenario/map/Earth3/scenarios/

Keep in mind that the game will always prioritize reading scenarios from the mods folder.
If you need to edit the scenario, it's recommended to temporarily move it from mods/YOUR_MOD_NAME/map/MAP_NAME/scenarios/ to the map/MAP_NAME/scenarios/

All data for the scenario will be read from the mods/ folder if the scenario exists.
The game will save any changes made to the scenario in the game files at map/MAP_NAME/scenarios/ not your mod folder!

#####

Once it's ready, you can share your scenario by opening the game, then going to Editor -> Steam Workshop, and selecting your unique mod folder name!

You can put multiple scenarios in your mod, as many as you want!

To update a mod in the Steam Workshop, simply do the same thing as when you published the mod
