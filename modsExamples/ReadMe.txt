## To create a new mod for submission to the Steam Workshop, first create a new folder for your mod within the 'mods' directory.
## Then, copy or recreate all the modified files into that folder!
##
## For example, if a file was originally located in game/ExampleFile.json, 
## it should be placed in mods/YourModName/game/ExampleFile.json in your mod's folder.
##

This is just an example folder for mods.

The actual mods folder is:
mods/

Each new mod should be placed in a dedicated folder, such as:
MyOwnMod_A_L/

mods/MyOwnMod_A_L/


Use own unique name for the folder name!

Empty prepared mod folders can be copied to the mods/ folder, and then you can rename the folder to its unique name:

modsExamples/_EmptyFolders/
